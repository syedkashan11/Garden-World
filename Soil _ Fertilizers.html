        <h1>Fertilizer :</h1>
      <p>fertilizer, natural or artificial substance containing the chemical elements that improve growth and productiveness of plants. Fertilizers enhance the natural fertility of the soil or replace chemical elements taken from the soil by previous crops.</p>
      <p>Soil fertility is the quality of a soil that enables it to provide compounds in adequate amounts and proper balance to promote growth of plants when other factors (such as light, moisture, temperature, and soil structure) are favourable. Where fertility of the soil is not good, natural or manufactured materials may be added to supply the needed plant nutrients. These are called fertilizers, although the term is generally applied to largely inorganic materials other than lime or gypsum.</p>

      <h1>Essential plant nutrients :</h1>
      <p>In total, plants need at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Plants obtain carbon from the atmosphere and hydrogen and oxygen from water; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although plants contain sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of silicon and aluminum.</p>
      <p>Overall chemical analyses indicate that the total supply of nutrients in soils is usually high in comparison with the requirements of crop plants. Much of this potential supply, however, is bound tightly in forms that are not released to crops fast enough to give satisfactory growth. Because of this, the farmer is interested in measuring the available nutrient supply as contrasted to the total nutrient supply. When the available supply of a given nutrient becomes depleted, its absence becomes a limiting factor in plant growth. Excessive quantities of some nutrients may cause a decrease in yield, however.</p>
      <h1>Determining nutrient needs :</h1>
      <p>Determination of a crop’s nutrient needs is an essential aspect of fertilizer technology. The appearance of a growing crop may indicate a need for fertilizer, though in some plants the need for more or different nutrients may not be easily observable. If such a problem exists, its nature must be diagnosed, the degree of deficiency must be determined, and the amount and kind of fertilizer needed for a given yield must be found. There is no substitute for detailed examination of plants and soil conditions in the field, followed by simple fertilizer tests, quick tests of plant tissues, and analysis of soils and plants.</p>
      <img style="height: 550px; width: 400px; float: right;" src="image/fertilizer 3.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Sometimes plants show symptoms of poor nutrition. Chlorosis (general yellow or pale green colour), for example, indicates lack of sulfur and nitrogen. Iron deficiency produces white or pale yellow tissue. Symptoms can be misinterpreted, however. Plant disease can produce appearances resembling mineral deficiency, as can various organisms. Drought or improper cultivation or fertilizer application each may create deficiency symptoms.</p>
      <p>After field diagnosis, the conclusions may be confirmed by experiments in a greenhouse or by making strip tests in the field. In strip tests, the fertilizer elements suspected of being deficient are added, singly or in combination, and the resulting plant growth observed. Next it is necessary to determine the extent of the deficiency.</p>
      <p>An experiment in the field can be conducted by adding nutrients to the crop at various rates. The resulting response of yield in relation to amounts of nutrients supplied will indicate the supplying power of the unfertilized soil in terms of bushels or tons of produce. If the increase in yield is large, this practice will show that the soil has too little of a given nutrient. Such field experiments may not be practical, because they can cost too much in time and money. Soil-testing laboratories are available in most areas; they conduct chemical soil tests to estimate the availability of nutrients. Commercial soil-testing kits give results that may be very inaccurate, depending on techniques and interpretation. Actually, the most accurate system consists of laboratory analysis of the nutrient content of plant parts, such as the leaf. The results, when correlated with yield response to fertilizer application in field experiments, can give the best estimate of deficiency. Further development of remote sensing techniques, such as infrared photography, are under study and may ultimately become the most valuable technique for such estimates.</p>
      <h1>The economics of fertilizers :</h1>
      <p>The practical goal is to determine how much nutrient material to add. Since the farmer wants to know how much profit to expect when buying fertilizer, the tests are interpreted as an estimation of increased crop production that will result from nutrient additions. The cost of nutrients must be balanced against the value of the crop or even against alternative procedures, such as investing the money in something else with a greater potential return. The law of diminishing returns is well exemplified in fertilizer technology. Past a certain point, equal inputs of chemicals produce less and less yield increase. The goal of the farmer is to use fertilizer in such a way that the most profitable application rate is employed. Ideal fertilizer application also minimizes excess and ill-timed application, which is not only wasteful for the farmer but also harmful to nearby waterways. Unfortunately, water pollution from fertilizer runoff, which has a sphere of impact that extends far beyond the farmer and the fields, is a negative externality that is not accounted for in the costs and prices of the unregulated market.</p>
      <p>Fertilizers can aid in making profitable changes in farming. Operators can reduce costs per unit of production and increase the margin of return over total cost by increasing rates of application of fertilizer on principal cash and feed crops. They are then in a position to invest in soil conservation and other improvements that are needed when shifting acreage from surplus crops to other uses.</p>
      <h1>Synthetic fertilizers :</h1>
      <img style="height: 550px; width: 400px; float: right;" src="image/fertilizer 4.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Modern chemical fertilizers include one or more of the three elements that are most important in plant nutrition: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Of secondary importance are the elements sulfur, magnesium, and calcium.</p>
      <p>Most nitrogen fertilizers are obtained from synthetic ammonia; this chemical compound (NH3) is used either as a gas or in a water solution, or it is converted into salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium phosphate, but packinghouse wastes, treated garbage, sewage, and manure are also common sources of it. Because its nitrogen content is high and is readily converted to ammonia in the soil, urea is one of the most concentrated nitrogenous fertilizers. An inexpensive compound, it is incorporated in mixed fertilizers as well as being applied alone to the soil or sprayed on foliage. With formaldehyde it gives methylene-urea fertilizers, which release nitrogen slowly, continuously, and uniformly, a full year’s supply being applied at one time.</p>
      <p>Phosphorus fertilizers include calcium phosphate derived from phosphate rock or bones. The more soluble superphosphate and triple superphosphate preparations are obtained by the treatment of calcium phosphate with sulfuric and phosphoric acid, respectively. Potassium fertilizers, namely potassium chloride and potassium sulfate, are mined from potash deposits. Of commercially produced potassium compounds, almost 95 percent of them are used in agriculture as fertilizer.</p>
      <p>Mixed fertilizers contain more than one of the three major nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Fertilizer grade is a conventional expression that indicates the percentage of plant nutrients in a fertilizer; thus, a 10–20–10 grade contains 10 percent nitrogen, 20 percent phosphoric oxide, and 10 percent potash. Mixed fertilizers can be formulated in hundreds of ways.</p>
